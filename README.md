# TPJS-PRACTICES
Native JS Single Page App to app for a better apprehension of Frontend Frameworks 

This is a very simple app consisting of reviewing most used Javascript API for DOM manipulation.

It's about a phone catalog, presenting a page for listing phones, description snippets and phones thumbnails, 
on a thumbnail click, it shows another layout presenting the phone details. 

You will notice that all this stuff is done on the same page, just to demonstrate what we can achieve with DOM manipulation, 
despite the seamless complexity.

Going through this sample will help you have a better understand the purpose of frontend frameworks and libraries such as <a href="https://angular.io">angular</a>,
<a href="https://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.5.3">ExtJs</a> or <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>

An explanatory video tutorial on how to setup this example step by step from stratch is being made and will be soon available on
